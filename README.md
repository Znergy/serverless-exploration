# Cool stuff with the Serverless Framework

## Description
Creating a CRUD RESTful API with Lambda + API Gateway, DynamoDB table with two GSI's, and an S3 bucket using the Serverless Framework and CloudFormation. I'm also looking into various ways to test lambda both locally and hopefully achieve some automated testing as well.

## Cool Stuff
I'm diving a lot deeper into the serverless framework and seeing the crazy possibility it brings, I've started also diving deeper into CloudFormation which has blown my mind. The idea that I can write all of my infrastructure in a single file and just run 'sls deploy', is incredible! I've been aware of this from a distance for a long time, but actually writing it and seeing the result is so much different. I've usually taken the manual route due to the overwhelming nature of all of the different pieces, but it's not that bad. Awesome!

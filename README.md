## Description
Creating a CRUD RESTful API with Lambda + API Gateway, DynamoDB table with two GSI's, and an S3 bucket using the Serverless Framework and CloudFormation. I'm also looking into various ways to test lambda both locally and hopefully achieve some automating testing as well.

## Cool Stuff
I'm diving a lot deeper into serverless and seeing the crazy possibility it brings, I've started also diving deeper into CloudFormation which has blown my mind. The idea that I can write all of my infrastructure in a single file and just run 'sls deploy', is incredible! I've been aware of this from a distance for a long time, but always took the manual route, this is so awesome!
